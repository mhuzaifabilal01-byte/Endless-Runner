# 🏃‍♂️ Endless Runner Game (Unity 3D)

A fully-featured, ready-to-play 3D Endless Runner game template built with Unity and Universal Render Pipeline (URP). This project serves as a comprehensive reference implementation for building mobile-optimized endless runner games (similar to Subway Surfers or Temple Run).

## ✨ Features

*   **🎮 Responsive Multi-Platform Controls:** Built-in `SwipeManager` supporting touch gestures (swipes left/right/up/down) for mobile devices, and Keyboard inputs (A/D/Space/S) for desktop play.
*   **🛣️ Dynamic Infinite Tile Spawning:** Memory-efficient `TileManager` and custom `ObjectPool` system that dynamically spawns, recycles, and positions road tiles as the player advances.
*   **🌌 Floating Origin System:** Solve vertex jittering and precision issues with `FloatingOrigin.cs`, which resets the scene's spatial origin dynamically as the player travels extreme distances.
*   **🛒 In-Game Shop & Skins:** Unlockable character skins/models purchased with collected gems. Local data persistence is managed seamlessly through `PlayerPrefs`.
*   **💵 Mobile Monetization Ready:** Integrated Google Mobile Ads SDK with configurations for Banner, Interstitial, and Rewarded Ads (`AdManager.cs`).
*   **🔊 Audio & UI Systems:** Centrally managed background music, sound effects, high score tracker, custom fonts, and main/game-over menus.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

*   **Engine:** Unity (URP - Universal Render Pipeline)
*   **Language:** C#
*   **Architecture Pattern:** Component-based with Managers (e.g., `PlayerManager`, `TileManager`, `AdManager`, `ShopManager`).
*   **Optimization:** Custom object pooling to avoid runtime garbage collection hiccups from continuous spawning/destroying.
